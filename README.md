# Arcanum
 
Arcanum is a work in progress game engine that will try to solve the problems of modern game engines with their abruptive workflow. Instead of using source control as the main way of sharing progress with other developers, Arcanum targets to be able to collaborate live in engine. While using git as a source control or for back-up handling. It will try to sync up virtually all disciplines jobs so the creative workflow can continue without any need to shutdown or go to a third party interface to sync with others.

The current state of this project is in its starting phase, is highly experimental, and will most likely not run on others computers due to the lack of SDKs and or software/hardware differences. A roadmap will be posted in the upcoming future.
